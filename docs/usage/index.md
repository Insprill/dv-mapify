# Using Maps

## Installing Maps

### Vortex

The easiest way to install maps is to use [Vortex][vortex] with the [Derail Valley Support Extension][vortex-dv].

To install a map from Nexus Mods using Vortex, click `Mod Manager Download` instead of `Manual Download` on the `Files` tab of the mod.
This will open Vortex, and prompt you to install the map.

### Manual

To install maps manually, just unzip the downloaded file into your game's install directory.

If you aren't sure where your game is installed, you can right-click the game in your library, and go to `Manage` -> `Browse local files`.
![Steam Browse Files][steam-browse-files]


Once unzipped, the `mapInfo.json` file should be located at `Derail Valley/BepInEx/content/maps/Map Name/mapInfo.json`.


## Changing Maps

When creating a new session in Career or Sandbox mode, you can select the map you want to play on.
If a session has already been loaded, you cannot change the map.
