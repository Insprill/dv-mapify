Mapify is a [Derail Valley](https://www.derailvalley.com/) mod for creating and loading custom maps.
Here you can find all the information you'll need to create maps and contribute to the project!

If you want to start creating maps, head to the [Project Setup](./creatingmaps/project-setup.md) page.
If you want to contribute to the project through code or documentation improvements, check out the [Contributing](./contributing/index.md) page.

If you're just a user who wants to install and use maps, visit the [Using maps](./usage/index.md) page.
