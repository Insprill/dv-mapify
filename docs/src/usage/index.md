# Using Maps

## Installing Maps

### Vortex

The easiest way to install maps is to use [Vortex][vortex] with the [Derail Valley Support Extension][vortex-dv].

To install a map from Nexus Mods using Vortex, click `Mod Manager Download` instead of `Manual Download` on the `Files` tab of the mod.
This will open Vortex, and prompt you to install the map.

### Manual

Maps can be installed manually like any other mod in the Unity Mod Manager GUI.



## Changing Maps

When creating a **new** session in Career or Sandbox mode, you can select the map you want to play on just below the difficulty.
If a session has already been loaded, you cannot change the map.
